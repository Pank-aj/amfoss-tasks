This was an easy task.
There was some syntax errors along with some other errors.... Errors mostly included the absence of ';' and a function bracket,thus consisting of 8 syntax errors.Also all the errors concluded by changing the label name.
Since I was not familiar with java..it took quite time to understand eveything.But I'm happy that I learned a lot in the process.
